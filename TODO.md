- `GenerateExtensionMethodWrapper` - Add generic constraint handling
- New tool: `GenerateTestStub` - Create unit test templates for methods
- New tool: `GenerateDocumentationSkeleton` - XML doc templates with parameter descriptions

**Implementation**: Enhance existing generators with template parameters and add new generation capabilities.

## Low Priority - Quality of Life Improvements

### TODO-009: Add Response Mode Options
**Priority**: Low | **Complexity**: Low  
**Context**: Some responses are verbose for AI consumption. Adding summary vs detailed modes would improve usability.

**Implementation**:
- Add `mode` parameter to relevant tools: `summary` | `detailed` | `minimal`
- `GetMemberDetails` - Summary mode returns only essential info
- `SearchTypes`/`SearchMembers` - Summary mode returns only names and IDs
- `GetDecompiledSource` - Summary mode returns signature + documentation only

### TODO-010: Consolidate Overlapping Tools
**Priority**: Low | **Complexity**: Medium  
**Context**: Some tools have overlapping functionality that could be streamlined.

**Consolidation Opportunities**:
- Merge `FindUsages`, `FindCallers`, `FindCallees` into single `AnalyzeUsages` tool with direction parameter
- Combine `GetOverrides` and `GetOverloads` into `GetMethodRelationships`
- Unify `SearchAttributes` with general search tools using attribute filters
- Consider merging simple getters like `GetMemberSignature` into `GetMemberDetails`

**Benefits**: Simpler API surface, reduced cognitive load, fewer edge cases to handle.

### TODO-011: Enhance Error Reporting and Diagnostics
**Priority**: Low | **Complexity**: Low  
**Context**: Current error handling is good but could provide more actionable feedback.

**Improvements**:
- Add error codes for common scenarios (assembly not loaded, invalid member ID formats)
- Include suggestions in error messages ("Did you mean..." for fuzzy member ID matches)
- Add diagnostic tool `ValidateAssembly` for health checks
- Enhance `GetServerStats` with performance metrics and warnings

### TODO-012: Add Batch Operation Consistency
**Priority**: Low | **Complexity**: Medium  
**Context**: Only `BatchGetDecompiledSource` exists. Other operations could benefit from batching.

**New Batch Tools**:
- `BatchResolveMemberIds` - Resolve multiple member IDs efficiently
- `BatchGetMemberDetails` - Get details for multiple members
- `BatchFindUsages` - Find usages for multiple members with combined results
- `BatchAnalyzeComplexity` - Analyze multiple methods for complexity metrics

**Benefits**: Reduced round-trip overhead for AI agents processing multiple items.

## Technical Debt and Maintenance

### TODO-013: Address Nullable Reference Warnings ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All nullable reference warnings resolved, build shows 0 warnings.

### TODO-014: Consider ServiceLocator Alternatives
**Priority**: Low | **Complexity**: High  
**Context**: ServiceLocator pattern is functional but could be replaced with more modern DI patterns.

**Options**:
- Implement proper DI container usage in MCP tools
- Use factory pattern for service creation
- Consider whether static tool methods are the best approach vs instance-based tools

**Note**: This is architectural and should be carefully considered as it affects the entire tool implementation pattern.

### TODO-015: Performance Optimization Review
**Priority**: Low | **Complexity**: Medium  
**Context**: Current implementation prioritizes correctness over performance. Some optimizations could improve AI workflow speed.

**Areas to Investigate**:
